_This is the overview page for area_ :classical_building: **Society**.

Everything that humans do collectively as a "society" goes in here. This involves
topics in economics, journalism, business etc. It also includes my general
rants and observations.

I'm particularly interested in collecting [Real Life Decision Making Systems](/kb/real-life-decision-making-systems).
This is a humbling excercise. Some decisions are reversible. Irreversible decisions
with large ripple effects may turn out to be deadly. We've already seen this with
COVID-19 and government responses, circa 2020. We cannot do without uncertainty
quantification and this is a page to remind myself of that.
