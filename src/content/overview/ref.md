_This is the overview page for area_ :books: **Reference**.

This area is dedicated to collecting reference materials. Take a look at
[Textbooks on various subjects](/kb/textbooks-on-various-subjects) for a comprehensive
list of reference texts on topics that have achieved _critical mass_. For now,
this is dominated by texts in machine learning. I'll expand this as I read more.

I'm collecting a set of [Common Yardsticks](/kb/common-yardsticks) to address
quantities that we encounter daily. This is my effort towards _numerical literacy_ and a
back-of-the-envelope temperament. Further, I am trying to map the modern
[World material](/kb/world-materials) flows qualitatively. This will help
me map the value chain and understand societies better. [Data Sources](/kb/data-sources)
should come in handy for this.
