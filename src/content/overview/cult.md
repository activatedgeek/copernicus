_This is the overview page for area_ :performing_arts: **Culture**.

This area includes everything that the human activity has produced in terms of
arts, media, food, literature, etc. In the performing arts, take a look at my
[Movies & TV](/kb/movies-and-tv) and [Music](/kb/music). I listen to a fair bit of
[Podcasts](/kb/podcasts) and try to read some [Books](/kb/books). I do have some
medium to long term goals on [Books I want to write](/kb/books-i-want-to-write).
I hate cooking, maybe because I suck. Nevertheless, I have some quick
[Recipes](/kb/cooking-recipes) for the desperate times.
