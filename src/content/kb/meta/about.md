I am Sanyam Kapoor and I do [normal science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_science). This website is my [knowledge base](/kb).

In 2013, I co-founded [StoryXpress](https://storyxpress.co/) with some
[great friends](https://www.forbes.com/profile/storyxpress/?list=30under30-asia-media-marketing-advertising#22c9b8ad1f85) to automate video creation at scale. I now work on [probabilistic machine learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14541) for automated decision-making.

> To be realistic, we must prune away the unlikely. What is left is necessarily a probabilistic statement. - [G. W. Stewart](https://doi.org/10.1137/1032121)

See [my CV](/cv) for a formal background.
