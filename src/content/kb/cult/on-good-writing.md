Crisp writing is an underrated skill.
Good writing implies clear thinking, and clear thinking is invaluable.
Here I collect resources that I keep visiting over and over.

## Guidelines

- It is _always_ about the people.
- "Something must be at stake".
- Capture the larger story.
- Write about at most one big thing.
- Be relevant.
- Be relatable.
- Be conversational.
- Make it happening.
- Use metaphors!
- Stick your landing, most interesting elements towards the end.
- Simple words, clear ideas, and short sentences.
- Don't shy away from complex ideas.
- Do not overestimate what the reader knows.
- Do not underestimate the reader's intelligence.

### Mechanics

- Use passive voice sparingly.
- Narrative over lists.
- Nouns not adjectives.
- Cut mercilessly.
- Callbacks.

### Strunk's Rules

This is a summary from the excellent book by William Strunk Jr.\_,
[The Elements of Style](https://www.librarything.com/work/3407/book/193494864).

- [Rule 1] Always use **'s** (appostrophe s) to form singular possessive nouns. Some ancient
  proper nouns ending in _-es_ or _-is_ are an exception but the sentence can be
  restructured to sound better.
  > _Moses' laws_ can be rewritten as _the law of Moses_.
- [Rule 2] With a series of comma-separated terms, no need for the last one.
  > supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
- [Rule 3] Parenthetic expressions can be enclosed in commas. These must, however, be used
  sparingly. Often, one can compromise on succinctness and break such phrases
  into multiple independent statements.
  > Linear regression, one of the most popular methods, is an example of supervised learning.
- [Rule 4] In some sentences, connectors _and_ or _but_ do not explicitly define the relation between
  connected clauses. Instead, the sentences can be structured better using explicit
  relational qualifiers like _although_, _while_, etc.
  > _Linear regression is a regression method, but logistic regression is a classification method_ v/s
  > **_While linear regression is a regression method, logistic regression is a classification method_**.
- [Rule 5] A single compound sentence composed of complete clauses can be connected
  using a semi-colon ";" instead of a full stop; this is helpful to disambiguate
  pronouns like _this_, _they_, _it_, etc. Alternatively, we can fall back to using
  commas as usual with proper relational qualifiers.
- [Rule 9] A paragraph should either denote a single unit in a composition or
  signal a new development of the subject from the previous paragraph. Single
  sentence paragraphs should be used sparingly, only as a connecting thread between
  the predecessor and successor.
- [Rule 10] Within a paragraph, the first sentence can be the topic sentence,
  and the final sentence can emphasize a consequence of the discussion. Although,
  violating this thumb rule often breaks the monotony for the reader.
- [Rule 11] Use active voice to enforce directness.
- [Rule 12] Use positive statements; limit the use of _not_ qualifiers.
- [Rule 13] Omit needless words.
  > _She is the one who_ should be replaced by **_She_**.
- [Rule 15] Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form. Correlative expressions
  should be followed by the same grammatical construction.
  > _the Bayesians and frequentists_ should be **_the Bayesians and the frequentists_**
- [Rule 16] Keep related words together. Parenthetic clauses can
  be transferred to the beginning of a sentence to avoid reading interruptions.
- [Rule 18] The proper place for emphatic words, which the writer desires to make
  most prominent, is towards the end of a sentence.
  > _Neural networks have hardly advanced our understanding of the human brain, though
  > they are behind many breakthroughs in computer vision._ v/s
  > _Neural networks are behind many breakthroughs in computer vision, but they have
  > hardly advanced our understanding of the human brain_.
