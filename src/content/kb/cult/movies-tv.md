For better or worse, I watch a lot of TV and movies. According to
[TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org), I've seen $>1000$ titles as of last writing.

!> :bar_chart: See some pretty plots on this data [here](https://perhapsbay.es/plots).

An unintended consequence of watching too many movies is that I always try to
look for the writer's beneath-the-surface motives far too often. Sometimes it
ruins the pleasure of watching a movie, but it is also fun to extract
meta-lessons. May be I can distill them some day.

## Resources

I migrated away from IMDb to TMDB, a community-driven effort. I like to think of
it as the Wikipedia for movies & TV. I occasionally contribute an edit or two.

For a great place to find movies, see
[agoodmovietowatch.com](https://agoodmovietowatch.com) for human-curated lists.

| :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 2    | Ridiculous; should not have been made.                                        |
| 2      | Below par in more than one of story/acting/dialogues/screenplay.              |
| 2.5    | Average movie; straighforward plot; nothing exciting.                         |
| 3      | Decent movie;                                                                 |
| 3.5    | Good movie;                                                                   |
| 4      | Very good movie; at least one interesting idea or event.                      |
| 4.5    | Very good movie; evokes conflicting emotions, either via story or screenplay. |
| 5      | Excellent movie; oddballs, blows the mind, question existence.                |
