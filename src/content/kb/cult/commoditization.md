I came across this Reddit thread about [unique NYC shopping experiences you cannot get anywhere else](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/16u3ek5/unique_nyc_shopping_experiences_you_cannot_get/). It makes me chuckle.

Commoditization has made goods and services so standardized in the West, that simple things like cutting rubber to measure is now almost a rarity. In India, one can go to any hardware store and they would find a way to do it for you. I don't think it is the case that Indian markets are not commoditized, but perhaps less so.

It is a dreamy window into the world that once was, almost walking through a live museum of civilization's artifacts, watching as it atrophies.
