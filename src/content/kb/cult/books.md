In recent times, I've warmed up to a variety of themes from history, philosophy,
economics and technology. These are
books meant to be less technical in flavor and rather more about putting broader
perspectives in context.

## Resources

[LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/) is extremely helpful for managing book collection, and has a large & healthy community.

!> :books: Also see [Textbooks on Various Subjects](/kb/textbooks-on-various-subjects) for books with more technical treatment.

### Rosetta Stones

I like these resources that provide books that act as portals to domains that
are usually complicated by jargon, or generally inaccessible.

[Very Short Introductions](https://www.veryshortintroductions.com) is a great
place for short and light reads of usually less than 200 pages. It covers a
broad array of topics. I only use this resource to get a sense of fields that
are alien to me.

[Beginner's Guides](https://oneworld-publications.com/series/beginners-guides/)
is a collection of about 120 books (at the time of this writing) about the biggest
ideas of our time. I have not sampled any book yet, but seems like a very rich collection!

### People's Libraries

[GatesNotes](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books) maintains a popular collection of
book reviews.

Blas Moros maintains an excellent library on [The Rabbit Hole](https://blas.com/library/) as well.

I am also curious about Alex Kasman's reading list on [Mathematical Fiction](https://kasmana.people.cofc.edu/MATHFICT/readinglists.php). The recommendations are grouped by age/expertise; some titles look fascinating!

[Computing the Human Experience](https://computingthehumanexperience.com/books/) has books about the past and future of technology.

### Services

I also like the mission of [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org), and ended up donating a tiny amount. I highly recommend checking them out as well, since they allow book loans. [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org) reformats and typesets many DRM-free titles.

[Five Books](https://fivebooks.com) provides (expert-)curated list of five books on a variety of topics. [Shepherd](https://shepherd.com/) is another upcoming service that aims to bring the experience of browsing a bookstore to the web. It also has curated recommendations from authors. [Hacker News Books](https://hackernewsbooks.com) newsletter is also often resourceful.

[A Book Like Foo](https://abooklikefoo.com) is an interesting
search engine for books. [thriftbooks](https://www.thriftbooks.com) lives up to its name, and provides cheap (used) books in good condition!

[Planet EBook](https://www.planetebook.com/) has free e-books for many popular classic titles.

### Philosophy of Math
