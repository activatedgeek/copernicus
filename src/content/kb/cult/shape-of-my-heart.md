## Lyrics Excerpt

> He deals the cards to find the answer
>
> The sacred geometry of chance
>
> The hidden law of a probable outcome
>
> The numbers lead a dance

I like this song's philosophical underpinnings - "a gambler who gambles not to win but to try to figure out something; to figure out some kind of mystical logic in luck, or chance; some kind of scientific, almost religious law."
