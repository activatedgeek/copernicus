> Choose life. Choose a job.
> Choose a career. Choose a family.

> Choose a fucking big television.
> Choose washing machines, cars,

> compact disc players,
> electrical tin openers.

> ...

> Choose good health,
> low cholesterol and dental insurance.

> Choose fixed-interest
> mortgage repayments.

> Choose a starter home.
> Choose your friends.

> Choose leisure wear
> and matching luggage.

> Choose a three-piece suite
> on hire purchase
> in a range of fucking fabrics.

> Choose DIY and wondering who the fuck
> you are on a Sunday morning.

> Choose sitting on a couch watching
> mind-numbing, spirit-crushing game shows

> stuffing fucking junk food
> into your mouth.
> ...

> Choose rotting away
> at the end of it,
> pissing your last in a miserable home,
> nothing more than an embarrassment
> to the selfish fucked-up brats
> that you've spawned to replace yourself.

> Choose your future. Choose life.

> But why would I want to do
> a thing like that?

> I chose not to choose life.
> I chose something else. And the reasons?

> There are no reasons.

> Who needs reasons
> when you've got heroin?

What did you choose today?
