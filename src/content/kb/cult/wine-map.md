At some point in the past, I was regularly tasting wines from across the world.
[Vivino](https://www.vivino.com) was where I tracked everything. On top of this,
I manually curated the lat/long values of each of the producing wineries. It is
a collection of a little over a hundred unique wines. Hopefully, I can continue
building this repository in the future.

The code and data is available at [activatedgeek/maps](https://github.com/activatedgeek/maps).

## The Indian Wine Scene

After having been an enthusiast and a so-called oenophile for a while, I've
realized I don't know much about the Indian wine ecosystem. I'm collecting
some stories here.

- [Sonal Holland](https://www.sonalholland.com), India's only Master of Wine (...so far)

- Namratha Prashanth's [inspiring story](https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/opinion/news-blogs-anson/solicantus-bordeaux-wine-namratha-prashanth-443741/) to her Bordeaux brand, Solicantus.
