## Ideas

### Numerical Literacy

Numbers are ubiquitous. The world would be meaningless without them.
Quite a few people hate the idea of operating with raw numbers and yet
unknowingly think in numbers. I want to write a book that contributes
to the numerical literacy of the general masses, ranging from
a middle-schooler to a retired professional. Numerical literacy
empowers us to rise above politics and rhetoric. It separates fact
from fiction. It describes the limit of physical systems. It allows us
a language to reason about the unknown.

_[Common Yardsticks](/kb/common-yardsticks) is my ongoing effort to crystallize the most important numbers for modern civilization._

### Material Flows

We interact with finished goods that have come from a long way from just
being stardust. Often, they have a unique history attached to them. I
want to pick the most pervasive materials in our society and map the
value chain that precedes them.

I was inspired by reading _Vaclav Smil_'s [Making the Modern World: Materials and Dematerialization](https://vaclavsmil.com/2013/11/01/making-modern-world-materials-dematerialization/). However, this book
left me unsatisfied. Despite being a wealth of resource and covering two chapters worth of material flows, it somehow covered too many numbers that
most people wouldn't care about. I want to give this book a visual twist and
rather make it more qualitative in its description than the thick quantitative style that Vaclav Smil chooses.

[Katy Börner](https://info.sice.indiana.edu/~katy/)'s series of altases are an inspiration.

_[World Materials](/kb/world-materials) is my exercise to collect the most
pervasive materials, partly noted from the above book._

### The Mythbuster

I was inspired by [Inoue Enryō](/kb/inoue-enryō). He was probably the real
mythbuster. Far too many people have succumbed to superstitions and
folklore. The need to explain the unknown via a divine intervention is
overrated and a hindrance to our development. In my ideal world,
everyone should be attracted towards the unexpected and unexplained instead
of conveniently explaining it away as "God's will".

I want to collect stories, especially in India, where overcoming such
a temperament has broken barriers and unleashed huge potential. If there
aren't such stories, I want to create them. I want to be a mythbuster.

## Resources

I had my first sense of what really goes behind-the-scenes with
Blake Boles's detailed [book publishing journey](https://www.blakeboles.com/2020/07/book-story/). Andre Garzia has specific recommendations for publishing in the article [Writing a Technical Book](https://andregarzia.com/2021/04/writing-a-technical-book.html).

[Stripe Press | Request for Projects](https://mollymielke.notion.site/Stripe-Press-Request-for-Projects-e43ed94b5b6440a88b8333153a7e982c) may have more ideas.

## Writing

I definitely need to hone my writing skills. See my other post
[On Good Writing](/kb/on-good-writing) for that.
