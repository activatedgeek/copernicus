[Be suspicious of stories | Tyler Cowen | TEDxMidAtlantic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoEEDKwzNBw)

This is perhaps the best TED(x) talk I've ever heard. It is of course Tyler Cowen, who has always been an excellent expositor.

The key idea is that all stories are meant to evoke an emotion. They are distilled to the nicest parts. But reality is _always_ messy. Next time you hear a story, don't lean too much into it, be suspicious.
