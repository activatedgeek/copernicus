[The Lessons of History](https://www.librarything.com/work/23856/book/193494927) by _Will Durant_, _Ariel Durant_ is quite an extraordinary piece of work.
Summarizing their own seminal volume on history of civilizations into just 100
pages is a momumental feat.

The short book opens with an extremely powerful set of questions, that I just
cannot stop thinking about.

Reading this book, past, present, and future seem grim. Plato's reduction of
political evolution to a sequence of monarchy, aristocracy, democracy, and
dictatorship seems uncomfortably fitting. This book makes me uneasy about the
future. I can only hope that the history presented in this book is never used to
justify the regressive ideas that many of our ancestors have fought hard against.
The cycle of despair that our civilization has kept falling into needs to end.

We can surely do better. Hindsight bias tends to dominate when reading and
presenting history. While history repeats itself, it only repeats in the outline.
As the famous quip, the devil is in the details. This is comforting and concerning
at the same time. I am comforted by instances of this in scientific research --
ideas in vogue often fall out of favor, but can come back stronger with fresh
insights. On the other hand, this is precisely what is concerning because
nature doesn't discriminate between right or wrong. The hope is that enough of
us "do the right thing".
