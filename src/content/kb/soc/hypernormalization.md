Based on [The antidote to civilisational collapse: An interview with the documentary filmmaker Adam Curtis](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/12/06/the-antidote-to-civilisational-collapse) (2018).

In the 80s, towards the last years of the Soviet Union, everyone from the top
to the bottom knew that Soviet society was not working, knew it was corrupt,
knew that bosses were looting the system, knew that politicians had no alternative
vision. Everyone just accepted the total sense of _fakeness_ as normal. This is what
Alexei Yurchak, a historian, labelled "HyperNormalization".

Adam Curtis, a documentary filmmaker, summarizes some excellent points in this
interview.

- Liberal journalism is locked in a theatre with pantomime villains. The real power
  is carrying on outside the theatre, which no one is analyzing.

- Erstwhile politics was driven by being part of a movement, a trade-union,
  a religious group, or a political party. Much of this has been supplanted by
  hyper-individualism, where everyone wants their unique expression and control
  their own destiny. Politics is virtually impossible at the individual level.
  Computer networks showed us, that we are not as different as we think we are.
  We are not very individualistic, and this is what modern politics then exploits
  via pattern matching.

- People prefer practically anything to poverty.

- With economic _risk_ dominating political landscape post mid-80s, much of politics
  became not about _changing-the-world-for-better_, but about _stop-bad-things-from-happening_.

- Issues like climate change, while certainly serious, are being coopted by
  a generation which is living under the fear of its mortality, and being turned
  into nightmarish scenarios. Instead, what we need is a calm head of power and
  policy restructuring.

- The questions of purpose and future vision are something politics has to answer,
  but it is not. Religion _used_ to answer, and science _used_ to try and answer.
  Somehow, it has become tech's Achilles heel. There will be a resurgence in
  religion, and these answers will again come from there [^a].

[^a]: I feel a little uncomfortable about this.

- The world is shaped by imagination. Mrs Thatcher used myths to inspire a nation
  towards something that is beyond the moment. The modern problem is that myths
  have washed over the complexities of the real world. This is where they begin
  to crack and go out of control.

- > No, you can’t control the world because it’s chaos—but there are moments within the chaos that you can use for your own purpose - Kutuzov

- People like Richard Dawkins led the counter-culture against religion. But
  once Obama pushed religion outside the White House, Dawkins became unfashionable [^b].

[^b]: Perhaps, we will see him see become fashionable again in this sense, given the resurgence of religious identities and conflicts.
