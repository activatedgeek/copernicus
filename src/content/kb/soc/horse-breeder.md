If someone asks me why do a PhD, I think I know exactly what to tell them -- to
become the horse breeder.

A solid amount of my time as a PhD student is spent _thinking about thinking_.
In the horse breeding metaphor, which Sabine Hossenfelder attributes to Steven
Weinberg [in her book](/kb/math-and-beauty),

> The horse breeder has seen a lot of horses, and now he looks at a horse, and

A researcher's life is no different. Among various competing theories, one must
pick the one that may explain the data, and perhaps the reality. But choosing
to pursue a theory comes at great cost in terms of the mindshare of the
community. The hallmark of a seasoned researcher is to pursue theories that,
more often than not, lead to significant progress -- their _beautiful horse_.

Of course, I don't think one needs a PhD to become the horse breeder. This
principle may be better advertised for life in general.
