We all want to change the world for the better but the truth is, most of us
won't. We can, however, support the ones who will and are. There is incredible
work being done at the grassroots level by people who never end up on primetime
news.

As [80000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/#career-categories)
explains in more detail, there are really only two ways to positively impact
societies - either get your hands dirty or help the ones who are. Although, most
of us will not end up with the influence to effect change, many of us will
earn enough to spare some for charity. I urge everyone to plegde a fraction of
their annual income to charity and revise this fraction as the circumstances
improve.

> I aim to donate **5% of my annual income** every year.

There is, however, a case to be made that charity doesn't help because if it
did, government subsidies would have solved poverty by now. As the most
famous philanthropist of our times, Bill Gates would have probably solved
many other problems by throwing money at the problem. There is some hyperbole
there, but you get the idea. This argument has some truth to it. There is a
reason why even the best-intentioned billionaires don't just donate all their
surplus. The missing piece is sustainability.

This brings me to my only advice on picking your next charity - if you
want to make sure that your money gets maximum bang for the buck, donate to
institutions that have established sustainability goals. Consider a charity
that helps farmers in times of drought by providing their families with food
packets and token money for the next season. These efforts would only be
worthwhile if the charity is also actively investing part of the money to
educate the farmers, say about drought tolerant crops. Further, introducing
them to new avenues of livelihood is even better. Every unit of money spent of
subsidies is a sustainability opportunity wasted. Without a sustainability
outlook, the next disaster will always demand more money. We don't want to be
relying on the mercy of a few rich souls.

For the ones that don't have an explicit sustainability goal, make a sensible
assessment - is the charity actively investing in sustainability goals?
This is not to say that charities focusing on short-term goals are any worse.
There will always be times when urgency will take priority over a long-term
strategy. I'm just prioritizing my money for the long-term. I hope the
government does its job in the short-term with the taxes we pay.

## My Recommendations

Here are a few that I either regularly donate to or have donated at least once
in the past.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page): Every single time
  free-flow of information suffered, societies suffered. Ask the residents of
  Philadelphia during the Great Influenza of 1918. Ask the people who suffered
  because of lack of information (or abundance of misinformation) during the
  COVID-19 pandemic.

- [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/about/donate): This is probably one of the best
  things to happen to open science.

- [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/donate/): Help the world get free
  SSL certificates. Protect your cyber home(s) from intruders. Don't even go
  near websites that don't have HTTPS at the least.

- [Swadesh Foundations](https://swadesfoundation.org): Help them in their
  mission of rural empowerment by fundamentally reorganizing sources of
  livelihoods in rural areas.

- [ACT Grants](https://actgrants.in): This is sort of an ensemble of members
  from the Indian startup ecosystem, helping solve India's pressing problems.
  Entrepreneurs are more often than not driven by a lot of passion, and build
  solutions that are sustainable.
