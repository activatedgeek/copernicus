We have ample evidence of the scientific method consistently outperforming
every other method to solve real-world problems. A wealth of books have been
written on the topic, detailing how the population mindset evolves with respect
to a new technology. Every single technology which we see as the norm today,
went through a phase of vehement pessimism. In retrospect, the technology in
question was obviously better than anything else and should have been a
no-brainer to get incorporated into daily lives.

Why is it then, that people still keep a closed mind? Why is it that despite
strong evidence, new ideas face insurmountable barriers?

In a sense, I've already answered my question by using the phrase _in retrospect_.
One could argue, it all only seems obvious in retrospect. Perhaps in some
corner of the scientific discourse today, a nascent idea is struggling because
of strong opinions held by people who can effect the strongest change. Worse
yet, an idea might have already reached positive consensus among the scientists,
but never be broadly adopted. The most prominent example is the
impending impact of climate change which still fails to capture a common man's
imagination, perhaps because of more immediate concerns compounded with false
narratives.

I conjecture that the onus lies with the act of communicating science. Proselytization
is tricky business. It is even trickier when a faith's core tenet relies on
questioning _everything_. A typical religion is touted to be set in stone despite
numerous instances of evolving beliefs. It is easier to get comfort knowing that
everything has a reason. The scientific method however, advocates us to keep an
open mind - we cannot reason everything, and perhaps, not everything has a reason.
