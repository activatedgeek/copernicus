I read a fable about the sun and the wind, in the book [How to Win Friends & Influence People](https://www.librarything.com/work/68250/book/199625301) by Dale Carnegie.

Quoting it here:

> They quarreled about which was the stronger, and the wind said,
> "I'll prove I am. See the old man down there with a coat? I bet I can get his
> coat off him quicker than you can.”

> So the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until it was almost a
> tornado, but the harder it blew, the tighter the old man clutched his coat to
> him.

> Finally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and then the sun came out from
> behind the clouds and smiled kindly on the old man. Presently, he mopped his
> brow and pulled off his coat. The sun then told the wind that gentleness and
> friendliness were always stronger than fury and force.

This lesson is personal. It seems like wisdom is dawning upon me after all
these years of youth spent in misdirected anger.
