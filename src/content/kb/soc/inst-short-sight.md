Our institutional structures \(perhaps unwittingly\) seem to condone reactive
short-term measures instead of pro-active long-term solutions. Short-term measures
correlate with the loudest buzz in popular media. I suspect this observation may
be consistent across all aspects of society - healthcare, security, privacy, politics,
economics and so on. In decreasing order of preference:

- Responding to a collapse: **Waaow!**
  - e.g. COVID-19 response in New York by Gov. Andrew Cuomo received with much fanfare despite delayed measures
- Preventing a collapse: **Good!**
  - e.g. COVID-19 response in California by Gov. Gavin Newsom has taken a backseat in pop media despite among the earliest measures in the US \(which shows up in the graphs\)
- Preparedness for collapse: **Who cares!**
  - e.g. Pandemic alarms by Bill Gates. I am fairly certain there were little pockets of academics and experts worried as well.
