Quoting this story that succinctly describes the tension between inventors and innovators
from a recent episode on the Naval Podcast with Matt Ridley on [How Innovation
Works](https://nav.al/matt-ridley).

Matt Ridley says,

> I like to tell the story that [Charles Towns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Townes), the inventor of the laser, used
> to tell, of a rabbit and a beaver looking at the Hoover Dam, and the beaver
> says to the rabbit, "No, I didn’t build it, but it’s based on an idea of mine."
> That is how inventors quite often think about innovations: "Come on, I had the idea!"
> But it’s a huge amount of work and talent to turn an idea into something
> practical.

After reading [The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Pajares/Kuhn.html)
by Thomas Kuhn, I think the Matt Ridley's book [How Innovation Works](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/how-innovation-works-matt-ridley?variant=32117444444194) seems like the perfect
sequel, possibly covering a broader base than just pure scientific research.
Looking forward to reading this!
