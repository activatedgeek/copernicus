The machine learning community (or AI more broadly) has collected truly extraordinary
trophies in its very short existence of half a century [^a]. The holy grail
of superhuman performance in some games has arguably been achieved. Chess was
conquered by [DeepBlue](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.99.2714&rep=rep1&type=pdf) in the '90s. More recently, [AlphaZero](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go) by Deepmind showed
us that machines can learn from scratch without explicit enumeration of rules.
The success of [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far)
is exemplar in this regard - we've beaten the world champion convincingly. More
recent results with [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) add to the growing
body of evidence that modern approaches can be scalable although, precise
understanding still eludes us. My examples are rather biased. Extraordinary achievements, however, are spread across all science.
They've achieved things that no previous generations could even imagine.

Without discounting the extraordinary achievements, these results are a natural
consequence of scientific deliberation. For the laymen, these
results of momentary awe often become embedded in their daily lives to the extent that
we take them for granted. Thankfully, extraordinary results usually live far longer
within the scientific discourse to allow for deeper investigation before inevitably
meeting the same fate. This fate, nonetheless, is a cause for celebration. It is
precisely this stature that every idea (and the scientist) hopes for.

Contrary to the fate of scientific discourse, superstition has captured the
imagination of people from time immemorial and still remains a vital component of many
societies today. I conjecture that scientific discourse and superstition
are more related to each other than we think and to an extent, might as well be
the same thing. Both aspire to provide humans the ability to know and even
influence the future. Both communities thrive on incomplete information, albeit in
rather different ways. One uses it to fuel investigations of truth while the other
only uses it as an engine of awe. Consequently, their fates are determined by this
characteristic. While one seeks to amass experimental evidence to invent or discover
natural laws, the other points to authority of yesteryears as irrefutable evidence.
For one welcomes change, the other shuns deviation from the norm [^b]. One believes
in action and the other relies on the act of belief itself.

Given that the (meta-)objectives of both communities are the same, it begs the question
of unifying the forces behind these two. Since unification is virtually impossible
given the fundamental contradiction in their theses, science supplanting
superstition is perhaps the more pragmatic goal. This thought is not remotely novel.
Every moderately superstitious person, part of the overwhelming majority, would
agree in a casual conversation that science should trump superstition. Why is it
that despite convincing evidence in favor of science, superstition holds so many
hostage? Understanding the answer to this question is precluded by our sense of the
context in which ideas permeate societies.

A recent quote from a [heartwarming post](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5566) has stirred me,

> With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil â€” that takes religion. - Steven Weinberg

In the absence of relevant context, no amount of proselytism can effect change. No facts, overwhelming evidence, and range of convincing arguments can deter the proponents of a potentially false theory. And the context lies herein - there hasn't been a convincing argument to the _need_ of supplanting superstition. Barring small
cults, everyday superstition remains innocuous to the level of being
non-existent. I, however, believe that this is a [boiling frog situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog) -
while everyday acts of superstition remain harmless, they perpetuate a cognitive
lethargy that hinders progress. It manipulates the layman to accept things for
how they are. Awe trumps curiosity and contentment precludes action.

The key question then remains - how do you convince a frog that the water is
really boiling?

[^a]: One could argue we go all the way back to [Galton in 1877](/kb/statistics-origins-and-people) although, I like to think otherwise.

[^b]: We must be careful not to give the scientific community too much credit for welcoming change. The story is less romantic than we like to think.
