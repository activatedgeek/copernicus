I'm collecting a list of real-life decision making systems that are primarily making data-driven decisions (hopefully with some level of human-in-the-loop) or are ripe to be disrupted by data-driven methods.

Use this list to convince someone about the importance of "uncertainty quantification".

- Predicting forest management actions of landowners with interdependent fire risk
  - [Evaluating wildland fire liability standards â€“ does regulation incentivise good management?](https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/WF19090)
- Estimating pandemic spread and intervention impact
  - [Report 13 - Estimating the number of infections and the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 in 11 European countries](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-13-europe-npi-impact/)
- Chip Placement on a canvas - optimizing power, performance and area under constraints like placement density and routing congestions
  - [Chip Placement with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10746)
