As a society, we've given into _nostalgia narratives_. But actually, this is not
new. This popped up in an episode of the [Pessimists Archive](/kb/podcasts).

The widespread usage of a car was fraught with deterrants. Generation X says
Generation Y sucks. Generation Y says Generation Z sucks. The 70s zeitgeist
beats everything else (for no real reason). Every parent and grandparent has a
story about how their times were better. Heck, even Trump's election campaign
built on "Make America Great Again". Can we agree on when precisely was America
great in the yesteryears?

So relatable!
