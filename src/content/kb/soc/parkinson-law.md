In 1955, C. Northcote Parkinson published an essay in _The Economist_ titled
"[Parkinson's Law](https://www.economist.com/news/1955/11/19/parkinsons-law)".

> Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.

The adage has stood the test of time. It questioned the need for the growing
number of civil servants. Instead, it suggested that organizations became
plagued by bureaucracy and inefficiency ensued. This theme is familiar and
still visible today.

A timely essay in _The Economist_ titled [Slackers and Stakhanovites](https://www.economist.com/business/2020/07/11/slackers-and-stakhanovites) is a fun take on the changing dynamics of
workplaces.

An alternative law for the _slackers_,

> For the unconcerned, when unobserved, work shrinks to fill the time required.

For the [Stakhanovites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakhanovite_movement),

> For anxious home workers, work expands to fill all their waking hours.
