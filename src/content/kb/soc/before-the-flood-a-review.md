I’ve been reading about DiCaprio’s quest to push the agenda of Climate Change
every now and then. It always came to me as ironic when I tried hard to look from
the perspective of a concerned citizen. DiCaprio is an entertainer and with this
altruistic act, he’s just pushing another hackneyed agenda forward from a position
of power. Speaking up abstract terminologies and interviewing policy makers and
stakeholders around the world — what good does that do? From the new documentary,
[Before the Flood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90CkXVF-Q8M), I appreciate the
introspective stance taken. It is particularly appealing to me because I was part
of a high school seminar presenting scores of statistics and solutions on Global
Warming, which today seems to be riding a greater wave of concern.

One of the first thoughts that immediately struck my mind was the carbon footprint
of making this documentary because it is pretty evident that the use of high-tech
research equipment and the usage of helicopters for transportation must have had
a long chain of impact. I was wondering, the carbon footprint of this documentary
could potentially be equal to a handful of people at the bottom of the pyramid from
India. Surprisingly, the documentary concludes by a note stating that the carbon
footprint was offset by paying a voluntary “Carbon Tax”. On moral grounds, that is
hilarious but, for all practical purposes, there is seriously no other choice!

Right from the beginning of the documentary, the narration presents a ubiquitous
tone of zero pretentiousness. While the developed nations have already reaped colossal
benefits out of fossil fuel consumption, they are inadvertently imposing unfair
restrictions on the developing nations where modern energy alternatives are still
far beyond a reasonable price point. This has been a major public policy shortcoming
which was quite unabashedly put forward by an Indian researcher and Government official
in the documentary. DiCaprio’s decision to include this piece of content, in a way,
testifies for his genuine concern to find an answer to the question — How can we
effectively transition towards an economy built upon sustainable energy?

The appalling state of political will has also been exposed in this documentary.
The narrator has made conspicuous claims of corruption at the highest levels around
the world by pointing direct fingers at the fossil fuel lobbyists. Politicians like
Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have been callous in their propaganda and
bending at the will of monopolies like _ExxonMobil_, _Shell_ and the _Koch Brothers_ who
are hiding under the veneer of so-called “Non-Profit Organizations”. Matters become
worse with the brazen denial and rejection of Climate Change as a mere delusionary
propaganda. This information is most likely not new, but judging it’s far reaching
impact in today’s connected world, it just might be another nail in the coffin for
the fossil fuel hegemony.

A discussion with Elon Musk, who’s been striving hard to bring Solar energy to the
mainstream, brings an interesting analogy to the table. The wireless cellular network
evolution which, followed the advent of wired landlines, enabled many of the remote
places to never wait for laying down of long distance wiring. Similarly, solar energy
can save us the hassle of laying down complex electricity grid systems and instead
make isolated self-sustaining power sources. It seems like a win-win for both economics
and the nature.

Barack Obama brings in another perspective to the concern and surely knows how to
communicate the concern to its direct stakeholders. Scientific arguments might not
ring a bell with the hoi-polloi for obvious reasons. It becomes a concern when the
consequences are more direct in nature. Data shows that the recent uprisings in the
Middle East are a consequence of Global Warming because resources are becoming scarce
and hence the escalation of unrest. Such extremist tendencies surely make Climate
Change a threat to national security.

While DiCaprio has played safe and only touched the surface of things, the documentary
does a fair job of putting forward a cogent argument for the awareness. One of the
unfortunate shortcomings of this documentary is that while it convinces everyone
of the big challenge lying ahead of us, steps being taken to mitigate this are still
unheard of and very selective in approach. A tectonic shift in policy is impossible
but concrete policies are yet to see the light of the day while the bottom of the
pyramid still adds more first-world challenges to its basket. All we see are talk
shows like the Paris Climate Agreement and the Kyoto Protocols of the yesteryears.
Are the policy makers listening?

Here’s a collection of my favorite quotes from the documentary which sum up the emotions.
