I am a subscriber of [The Economist](https://www.economist.com) and fairly
satisfied with the wide coverage. I've uninstall all other news applications across
all my devices. I like that my coverage is delayed by a few days (at most a week)
and never felt that I am missing out on anything. This allows for reporting that
is far more researched instead of mindless hyperboles. Opinion pieces are
usually well-balanced. The Economist, however, finds itself in a tough spot
on hot-button issue like race. Thankfully, the "Letters" section welcomes feedback
from many readers with opposing views and keeps the discourse healthy.

My main challenge is that there is much quality content but only little time to
consume. I characterize this, more dramatically, as an information firehose.
This post is an attempt to deliberately make up a preference order for topics
that matter to me the most.

## Everything

The Economist categorizes all articles into sections below [^a].

- The world this week
- Leaders
- Letters
- Briefing
- United States
- The Americas
- Asia
- China
- Middle East & Africa
- Europe
- Britain
- International
- Business
- Finance & economics
- Science & technology
- Books & arts
- Economic & financial indicators
- Graphic detail
- Obituary

Sometimes, there are other special sections.

- By invitation
- Special report
- Technology Quarterly

### My Picks

Barring a few interesting pieces in other sections, I'm usually most interested
in these.

- The world this week
- Leaders
- Letters
- Briefing
- Asia
- Finance & economics
- Science & technology
- Books & arts
- Graphic detail
- Obituary

## Reading Strategy

A set of pre-decided favorite sections has not been satisfactory. Not that I
want to read _everything_, I do feel there has to be a better reading strategy
to maximize impact.

The search for meta-processes for reading is still on.

[^a]: I will enumerate in more detail what each section is about at some point.
