There's been so many instances when I find things not being named after
the actual inventor. I finally have a name for this phenomenon.

[_Stigler's law of eponymy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler%27s_law_of_eponymy)
states that no scientific discovery is named after its inventor.

## Examples

- **Bayes theorem** was actually formulated and extended by Pierre-Simon Laplace.
- **Gaussian distribution** was actually invented by Abraham de Moivre.
- **Gram-Schmidt process** was known to Pierre-Simon Laplace.
- **Cauchy distribution** was first analyzed in detail by Poisson.
