Quoting from [DrawingMachines](https://drawingmachines.org/category.php?id=36)

> The Integraph is an integrator which not only indicates the final result of the integration, but also gives a graphic representation thereof; whilst the tracer travels round the outline of the figure, the integraph automatically draws a curve (integral curve) the ordinates of which are proportionate to the area of the figure travelled around...

I am very curious about how this works.
