Two things are certain in this decade for AI:

1. AI will become more accurate, safer, and steerable in the coming years.
2. The first wave of AI products will need a new crop of sharp _technical_ product visionaries, who do not carry a misguided sense of expertise from the SaaS era of previous decade. Inevitably, this crop of managers will get _commoditized_ very quickly.

Unfortunately, we still do not have a category-defining AI product.
And here's my (incomplete) list of reservations, sprinkled with predictions of how the markets will evolve.

## Chat is a Local Minima

Chat is almost certainly not the right interface for AI.
Quite noticeably, chat just requires too many human touch points.
Such an interface with friction from humans is a no-go for widespread deployment to reach [economies of scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale) with AI products.
In the quest for [Artificial General Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) (AGI), we may have forgotten the classic Unix philosophy behind great software,

> Write programs that do one thing and do it well.

We are stuck in a local minima for AI products with a chat interface which tries to do too much at once. But chat is a promising avenue for continued development.

A chat interface is a frictionless buy-in for early adopters trying to test the capabilities of an AI system.
With almost no vendor lock-in, chat interfaces are valuable but leaky user funnels.

Nevertheless, frictionless buy-in allows reaching critical mass for data collection and user feedback, getting broad coverage of possible user inputs.
I am convinced that the easiest way to make AI safe is by making all data in-distribution, i.e. all possible data distributions expected in-the-wild are amply available during model training.
In fact, in the absence of effective techniques to search for strong neural network priors or the lack of convincing progress over the last decade, I would stretch to claim that data engineering may be the only way.
Fortunately, [scaling laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_scaling_law) are alive and kicking.

In the absence of a category-defining product but with a critical mass of early adopters, the next best thing is to build an API platform and a distribution channel.
This approach is akin to the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) model which allowed iPhones to gain a competitive advantage very quickly after the launch, which to this day remains significant despite regulatory pressure.

However, the App Store model will _not_ apply to AI products precisely because of the lack of vendor lock-in. Any invention of a category-defining product that may arise from the democratized access to AI from major API providers is unlikely to benefit the provider.

API access is a race to the bottom without unique capabilities that take advantage of strong [vertical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration).

## AI Retrofitting is an Off-Ramp

[Robotic Process Automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation) (RPA), or the colloquial term "agents" is likely to be the first segment to fall to AI.[^a16z]

[^a16z]: a16z also bets on RPA [in their thesis](https://a16z.com/rip-to-rpa-the-rise-of-intelligent-automation/).

I really wish for AI to finally deliver on the promise of agents soon.
God knows how much human capital has been wasted on boring corporate grunt work.
Agents are also the perfect starting point to gain a strong moat from vertical integration - the cascading errors due to the inevitable chaining of agents can be better mitigated by keeping an end-to-end control of the input-output pipeline, without relying on opaque third-party providers.

However, RPA is an example of sustained innovation rather than a [disruptive innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation).
Enterprises with the widest customer base will win the first wave due to distribution advantage and the shortest cycle to bottomline impact.

This retrofitting dynamic of making existing processes more efficient by replacing with AI, will hinder the invention of a category-defining product.
A large market already exists for RPA, and unfortunately inertia will lead a large chunk of human capital to divert away from the grand goal for short-term results.

There is a silver lining - I expect that short-term success in RPA will sustain continued investment in AI research.[^datadog]
AI still needs a lot of work, and the market's appetite to keep the money flowing will be crucial.

[^datadog]: Datadog, a cloud monitoring platform, is creating [a new AI research lab](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/atalwalkar_ai-researcher-datadog-ai-research-datadog-activity-7288619424205406209-0Ni-/) betting on agents, led by a veteran ML researcher.

## The Missing Unit Economics of AI

Unlike [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service), the marginal cost of onboarding a new user for an AI product will remain high owing to the high CapEx of renting or owning GPUs.
These costs are certain to fall in the future, maybe even drastically to the point of today's commercial-grade servers.

Until then, we'll need alternate pricing models to sustain the AI momentum. The unit economics of AI agents can surely not use "per seat" pricing typically used by SaaS models.

Borrowing a pricing dynamic from manufacturing, the cost reduction from automation often gets passed straight to consumers, leaving manufacturers with little advantage.

The saving grace here will be a large enough demand that offsets the shrunken revenues, e.g. easy access to software creation will lead to an increased demand for software, a perfect flywheel. Moreover, entire industries like law and healthcare are ripe for software disruption that will keep the flywheel going.

## The Future of Computing

Steve Jobs' vision was crucial to elevate personal computers from a mere hacker's toy to a polished productivity tool for the non-technical masses.
Despite drawing much awe, AI deployment is too raw in its current form.

Perhaps, we are all looking in the wrong direction. The first breakthrough consumer AI product will not be in software but rather a paradigm shift in hardware. A good hardware product allows for vendor lock-in, strong vertical integration, and clear unit economics to kickstart a consumer AI revolution.
What if the [Humane AI Pin](https://humane.com), even though universally hated, was looking in the right direction?

In retrospect, [Google Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass) walked so that [Meta glasses](https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/) could run (more realistically just jog though).
