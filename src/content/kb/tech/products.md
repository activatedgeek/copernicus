Some are products I own and others I want to try/buy. Others are just generally good lifestyle upgrades.

!> See [Subscriptions and Services](/kb/subscriptions-and-services) for software recommendations.

## Home

- [**Moon Pod**](https://www.moonpod.co) - FEEL THE FUTURE OF RELAXATION
- [**Guy Buffet Lithographs**](https://spanek.com/cinematic.html) - Paintings like stop-frame animations by Guy Buffet.
- **Steamer for Clothes**
- **Vacuum Cleaner** - [Dyson v8](https://www.dyson.com/vacuum-cleaners/cordless/v8) works very well.
- **Candles** - [Diptyque Baies](https://www.diptyqueparis.com/en_us/p/baies-berries-candle-190g.html) classic candle.

## Kitchen

- **Air Fryer**
- **Instant Pot**

## Personal Care

- **Sunscreen** - [Biore UV](https://smile.amazon.com/Biore-Aqua-Watery-Essence-Sunscreen/dp/B07RW32L8W) feels incredibly lightweight due to its gel texture, is odorless, has no whitecast that is hard to rub off the face unlike many popular creams.
- **Moisturizer** - I was gifted [belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb](https://belifusa.com/products/the-true-cream-aqua-bomb), and it is great. [Aromatherapy Moisturizing Body Lotion](https://www.bathandbodyworks.com/p/lavender-vanilla-moisturizing-body-lotion-026353212.html?cgid=aromatherapy#start=5) or [Aveeno Body Lotion](https://www.aveeno.com/products/stress-relief-body-lotion-lavender-scent) are other good options.
- **Perfumes** - I love the [Diptyque 34 Boulevard Saint-Germain](https://www.diptyqueparis.com/en_us/c/34-boulevard-saint-germain.html). See also [Sasha Chapin](https://twitter.com/sashachapin/status/1453777748690804745)'s list.

## Electronics

- [**The Framework Laptop**](https://frame.work) - A thin and light notebook that looks as pretty as the Macbook, but as configurable as a home-built machine. In an ideal world, I could use all the macOS goodness on Linux via [Darling](https://www.darlinghq.org).
- [**Zimaboard**](https://www.zimaboard.com) - Single board server.
- [**Bambu Lab 3D Printer**](https://bambulab.com) - 3D printers are turning a page in their evolution. This will be an impluse buy if at all.

* [**AirPods Pro**](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/) - For solid noise cancellation with an easy form factor.
* **Noise Cancelling Headphones** - I recommend any of the [Sony WH-1000XM Series](https://www.sony.com/lr/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm5).
* [**Apple TV 4K**](https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-4k/) - I do not think there is a better user experience. Remains minimal, and gets out of the way quickly, something I have missed from other OEMs and Android.
* [**Daylight**](https://daylightcomputer.com) - A computer you can use outside, without the distractions.

## Lifestyle

- [**Midori Stationery**](https://md.midori-japan.co.jp/en/) - Perhaps the Apple for stationery. I would love a nice piece of paper to write down thoughts, instead of my private digital notebook.
