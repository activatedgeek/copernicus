## Thoughts

The big bet with Large Language Models (LLMs) is that they will abstract away the current paradigm of instructions on microprocessors with more widely accessible natural language. These models remain prone to high error rates, unable to reason, costly to deploy, not very well-understood by researchers, and overall skepticism of (non-)experts. None of these challenges, however, are unique to this technology.

When transistors first came out as a replacement for vacuum tubes, they were indeed prone to higher error rates too, and had very high manufacturing/distribution costs. The markets also lacked supply of engineers and technicians who had expertise in working with transistors. We have now overcome all that, such that the error rates and costs are economically viable. I do not see why LLMs cannot have the same trajectory.

A common theme I am seeing here is many products aim to compete with incumbents with strong PMFs with an LLM tacked on. Perhaps, the hope is that LLMs reduce friction at some contact points with the user. New segment-defining products are still limited and yet to have a breakthrough economically.
