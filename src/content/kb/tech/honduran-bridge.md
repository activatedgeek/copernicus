An article from 2018 titled [Why A Honduran Bridge Is A Perfect Metaphor For Disruption](https://medium.com/road-less-ventured/why-an-honduran-bridge-is-a-perfect-metaphor-for-disruption-2a2d7c910535)
caught my eye. Take a look at this picture.

The [New Choluteca Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choluteca_Bridge) in Honduras was constructed circa 1996-98, with the support
of the US government. It was a region known prone to extreme hurricanes.
As a result, some of the best architects and engineers were employed in its
construction. It became the largest bridge by a Japanese company in Latin
America.

In the same year it was commissioned for use, [Hurricane Mitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Mitch) hit hard. All
roads around it were obliterated. But as a testament to its integrity, the bridge
stood almost untouched. The hurricane wrecked the region so hard that the Choluteca River
changed its course, bypassing the bridge itself. This is what is pictured above.

This is indeed a nice metaphor for _disruption_. Perhaps, this is a literal
embodiment of Kuhn's _paradigm shift_. The lesson here is that it is not enough
to survey the landscape. Rather, it is imperative to anticipate the landscape
dynamics - where it goes next. This is as true for life in general as it is for
science and technology.
