I don't know if there's a way to answer this question definitively.
I believe ideas and innovation roughly follow a sine curve of progress. As a
society, we are perhaps in the second half of the downward sloped-part as of this
writing.

Interestingly, I found this website by Patrick Collison and Michael Nielsen - [https://scientificreturns.org](https://scientificreturns.org) [^a] which has a well-researched list of content.

[Peer-reviewed papers are getting increasingly boring](https://lemire.me/blog/2021/01/01/peer-reviewed-papers-are-getting-increasingly-boring/) by _Daniel Lemire_

_Noah Smith_ takes a softer stance on the idea of science-is-getting-harder
in the article [Answering the Techno-Pessimists, Part 4: Science Slowdown?](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/answering-the-techno-pessimists-part-9a2). The author
distinguishes between "slowing down" and "very difficult to sustain", and that's
where the nuance is.
