In computer science, [binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) is a tree data structure which consists of
nodes (that hold information) with at most two children. If not for this
structure, much of the modern compute would be stuck wasting endless CPU cycles
for seemingly trivial computations.

I think, [Dragon blood tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracaena_cinnabari)
is the closest thing in nature to binary trees from computer science.

Unfortunately, this tree is "Vulnerable" Globally, and part of the [IUCN
Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List).
