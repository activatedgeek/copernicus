It is extraordinary that we've found a way to figure out the age of materials.
I'm noting a few techniques that I encountered while reading and will update
when I find newer ones.

## Radiocarbon dating

Organic materials containing carbon can be dated via this method. $^{14}C$ is a
mild radioactive isotope that accumulates in a dead organism. $^{14}C$ is
naturally created in the atmosphere by the interaction of nitrogen with cosmic
rays. The decay of radioactive material is described by _half-life_ - the time
required for a material to be reduced to half of its initial value. The half-life
of $^{14}C$ is about 6000 years. Owing to this, there is a limit to how far back
we can reliably date using this method (50,000 years in this case).

## Luminescence dating

The key idea behind this luminescence dating starts under a similar premise but
goes beyond organic materials. Soils usually contain traces of radioactive isotopes
of elements. The ionizing radiation produced by these isotopes gets trapped in
buried quartz (silicon) and feldspar (potassium silicates) in unstable
_electron traps_ between the crystalline structure. When exposed to light, the
stored energy is released in the form of luminescence and measuring this is
related to the total time electrons were trapped in the crystals.

Under the correct conditions, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating
can reliably estimate upto 350,000 years.
