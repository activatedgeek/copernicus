I came across this article titled [Lights and Shadows](https://ciechanow.ski/lights-and-shadows/)
by _Bartosz Ciechanowski_. This is a great illustration of the Lambertian
model of light and surfaces and also has great references towards the end.

## Remarks

Other than being very informative about lights, this is an inspiring approach
in pedagogy. There are two aspects done right here. First, reach the right
level of abstraction on the topic and then decompose that level into well
thought out interactive visualizations.

### Nitpicks

The sliders for the interactive visualizations don't always tend to be
clear about its effect. Although, one could argue that playing with the sliders
and discovering its effect is part of the learning.
