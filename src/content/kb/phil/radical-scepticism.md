[Radical Scepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_skepticism) is the
philosophical position that knowledge is impossible. It leads to a paradox of
knowledge - we cannot really know everything.

I first learned about this concept in Duncan Pritchard's
[Scepticism: A Very Short Introduction](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/scepticism-a-very-short-introduction-9780198829164). This paradox of
knowledge felt extremely infuriating to me. It highlights scepticism of two
kinds - _healthy scepticism_ and _radical scepticism_.

A healthy sceptic believes that in principle all knowledge is falsifiable, no
matter how faint the possibility. This is only a concern when one
has a strong reason to feel that their current beliefs are build on the wrong
foundations. As long as it works, it works.

A radical sceptic, however, blows this tiny possibility of falsifying everything
to raise the paradox of knowledge - if all knowledge has the tiniest possibility
of being falsified, can we really be sure? I find this argument frustrating
because it put knowledge to an extremely harsh global standard and isn't
meaningful at all. Often, I find politicians relying on seemingly
innocuous realizations of this paradox in real life and that makes me cringe.
This also then leads to arguments around _truth relativism_ and no basis for
rationality.

I don't think I ever want to argue with a radical sceptic because it is
meaningless. It doesn't get anything done. Of course, for your armchair
philosopher, questioning the nature of reality and things like the simulation
hypothesis may be intellectually stimulating. I find Ludwig Wittgenstein's quote
for the basis of rationality most well-intentioned for the world as it is.

> If I want the door to turn, the hinges must stay put.

In the context of _probability theory_, it reminds me of [Cox's Axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%27s_theorem). In _geometry_,
it reminds me of [Euclid's postulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#Axioms). In _number theory_, it reminds me of
[Peano postulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms). I am certain
every field of scientific inquiry relies on such unquestionable "hinges" that
form the basis of rational thought and progress.

Isaac Asimov's [The Relativity of Wrong](https://chem.tufts.edu/answersinscience/relativityofwrong.htm) presents a well-reasoned piece, which is closely related
to this idea of absolutism in truth. To sum up in Asimov's words

> The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that "right" and "wrong" are absolute; that everything that isn't perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong.

In the context of scientific progress, this quote sums it up.

> Naturally, the theories we now have might be considered wrong in the simplistic sense ..., but in a much truer and subtler sense, they need only be considered incomplete.
