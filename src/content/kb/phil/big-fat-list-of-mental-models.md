!> [Mental Models: The Best Way to Make Intelligent Decisions](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) by Shane Parrish is a better list, and I simply refer to it now.

This is a collection of mental models I've read about. Makes for a good reference for the times I'm always stuck in _Déjà vu_, thinking "what's the term?". I will grow, evolve and categorize this list largely trying to understand / answer "what can I do to minimize negative externalities?", a meta-mental model for decision making in life.

This is a fat list and the purpose is not to memorize these. Instead, consciously aiming to learn them, utilize them as much as possible to fit things happening around into a model. This is reductive and simplifying, but that is precisely what models are for - to allow us focus on things that matter without the unnecessary details.

> We don’t become better at things we do – we become better at things we _pay attention to while we’re doing them_
