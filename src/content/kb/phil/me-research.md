Hard things are hard because there is no clear path forward. If there is, almost
anyone who has the motivation and requisite ability can pursue it. Eventually,
the hard thing often doesn't remain so hard after all.

We, as _scientists_, aim to forge this path through the process of _research_.
In this note, I document some meta-principles which I believe that if compounded
over time will make us better.

This living document has a self-improvement aesthetic. Its success, therefore,
relies on being more precise than abstract. I therefore keep behavioral
suggestions than merely feel-good platitudes. All principles are categorized by
their intrinsic nature - **Frog Principles** address the get-your-hands-dirty bits,
and **Bird Princples** address the big picture bits.

## Frog Principles

Frogs are always in the weeds, at the bottom of the forest floor. This is where
progress happens.

### Note Keeping

I have shied away from note making for the better part of my education - up
until my Masters degree. This goes to show the kind of structure there is
education programs, that one can get away with the bare minimum.

In the knowledge creation business, note-making is a superpower. The brain can
only handle first-order connections from reading, and that too only a few. Having
a solid note-taking regimen for _everything_ read allows the brain to avoid
recency bias and forgetting ideas. Over time, these notes become the raw
materials for developing higher-order connections - precisely what allows
scientists to create _new_ knowledge.

I prescribe a three-stage procedure to note-making:

- **Stage I**: Find an easy way to dump raw notes. This should have minimal
  friction to get the ball rolling. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
- 2**Stage II**: Reconcile/organize all notes into a personal notebook. Keep this2 private. I use extended Markdown and store all notes via Git.
- **Stage III**: Distill knowledge by making connections.

Stages I and II is where we will spend most of our time. Stage III will
and should happen only intermittently.

### Read Deep

Erdös was one of the most prolific mathematicians, most famous for his
around-the-world collaborations. Paul Halmos, another great mathematician
and mathematical expositor, recounts his genius in his [automathography](https://www.librarything.com/work/45908/book/197299283). Erdös was extremely
good at certain kind of combinatoric-geometric-arithmetic problems.

> It would happen that someone would ask him a question in a field that he knew
> nothing about; he then demanded that the basic words be defined for him, and if
> it turned out that his set-theoretic "counting" techniques were at all pertinent,
> he proceeded to find the answer.

It is increasingly clear to me that faster progress is made by diving
deeper. The reasons are simple - aiming to cover breadth as an early-career
researcher makes for shallow learning. Success in research, like any other
profession, relies on accummulating social capital. This is only built by
_first_ demonstrating expertise. No one calls a generalist an "expert".

Breadth subsequently becomes easier to tackle because it is easier to
contribute when riding the confidence wave of a successful track record.

As an actionable takeaway, during the working week, strictly defer reading
everything not directly connected to immediate research. This will allow
building an emotional connect to the problem, a prerequisite for mastery.
Reading deep also opens up avenues for differentiation when complemented with
the next principle.

### Read Wide

Jeff Bezos, in his final [2020 Letter to Shareholder](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders)
as the CEO of Amazon, emphasizes that typicality is easy to achieve and
the universe wants it. By only reading deep, one opens up to the risk of
becoming a _low entropy_ individual. To be atypical, one needs to supplement
depth with breadth. Creativity demands breadth, or else be stuck with the
_Two cultures_ problem.

The good news is that there is more than enough to discover and
learn. To this end, during the weekend, _strictly_ defer reading anything related
to immediate research project(s). Open up the mind by reading those deferred
research articles, making just enough notes to catch up in the near future.

For a more elaborate thesis on the importance of breadth, see this
excellent book [Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World](https://www.librarything.com/work/22766394) by David Epstein. [We need more Rogers](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Range).

## Bird Principles

Unlike frogs, the birds have the metaphorical _30000 feet view_. This is where
progress is consolidated.

### Introspection

Paul Horgan, a Pulitzer Prize-winner author and artist, emphasizes[^a]

> Illusion is first of all needed to find the powers of which self is capable.

Introspection is necessary to identify capabilities. This cannot happen during
the hustle to get the next experiment working, or churn the next paper out. It
can only happen with a quiet, undistracted mind. Identifying one's superpowers
is crucial; even an illusion of superpower can be impactful. Conducting research
from a position of strength is beneficial for both the outcome and happiness.

Therefore, strive to spend atleast an hour every week to introspect about the
desired aspirations and outcomes.

### Everything is Sales

In his essay [Harder Than It Looks, Not As Fun as It Seems](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/hard/),
Morgan Housel really drives home the point - _everything is sales_. This is true
for business, and just about everything else. This is why academic Twitter has
now become an exercise in supplementing every new paper with a tweet thread.
All the posturing aside, I don't think this is a bad thing. If you do not upsell
your research, who else will?

I believe many ideas win the _sales lottery_ [^b]. Good sales increases the
chance of compouding network effects. I am certain many career researchers would
be inspired by Michael Bronstein's excellent
[keynote at ICLR 2021](<(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6Pw4MOzMuo)>)
to either pivot their research towards geometric deep learning or at least
borrow ideas from this field.

Most research talks are terrible, aimed at sounding smart, than appealing to the
audience and making them feel smarter. In such a world, solid sales becomes a
great differentiator. Narratives are a powerful differentiating force. Remember,

> facts don't sell, stories about facts do; ideas don't sell, narratives about ideas do.

Read the [Think Different](/kb/the-think-different-researcher) cult manifesto
for some inspiration. Alas, this is an area that I really need to work hard at.

[^b]: Just like many ideas win the [The Hardware Lottery](https://hardwarelottery.github.io).

### Minimum _Viable_ Research

This is a twist on the classic product development strategy called
[minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP).
Colin Bryar and Bill Carr, in their new book [Working Backwards: Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon](https://www.librarything.com/work/25931835/book/201958866), emphasize
that we (including me) have focused too much on the _minimum_ of MVP. The
crucial aspect instead has always been _viable_.

Minimum viable research (MVR) is then the kind of research that has elements of
viability, and a low friction entry point for others to build upon. It is
almost easy to think how one's research could be viable, but exceptionally
hard to actually execute one.

While not always feasible, one way to judge when your research will be MVR is
simply to ask the classic question - _would you use it yourself?_

### The Overton Window of Research Ideas

The decade starting in 2010 marked the arrival of deep learning with a bang. Many
computer vision _purists_ were left behind, along with computational linguists
who did not embrace the representation learning afforded by large-scale neural
networks. While, only time will tell which school of thought stands the test of
time, the medium-term survival of the inflexible researchers was certainly put
at great risk. For now, deep learning has convincingly won, at least a significant
mindshare of AI research community.

[Overton Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window), originally used
in the context of policy-making, refers to the range of policies
_acceptable_ to the mainstream population at any given time. Despite all the
popular science depiction of scientists working on crazy ideas and pushing
boundaries, research is mostly incremental. The perceived impact, however,
crucially relies on what ideas are considered acceptable by the research community.
For the computer vision purists and computational linguists of the past, publishing
old methods was no more fashionable.

One must always grapple with maintaining relevance and vitality [^c]. This is
only possible when we have keen sense of the spirit of the times. Identifying the
_Overton window of research ideas_ is therefore imperative in research.
Thomas Kuhn would probably call displacements in the Overton window of research
ideas a [_paradigm shift_](https://www.librarything.com/work/9032361). One must
know where the wind blows.

[^c]: I also talk about this in [The "Think Different" Researcher](/kb/the-think-different-researcher).
