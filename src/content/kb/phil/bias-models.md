I had a [Big fat list of Mental Models](/kb/big-fat-list-of-mental-models) and it is exploding. A new paper proposes parsimony.[^@parsimonybias2023]

Six fundamental beliefs that bias our view of the world [^reftweet]:

1. My experience is a reasonable reference.
2. I make correct assessments of the world.
3. I am good.
4. My group is a reasonable reference.
5. My group is good.
6. People's attributes (not context) shape outcomes.
