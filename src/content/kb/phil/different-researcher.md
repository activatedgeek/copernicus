The [Think Different](http://www.thecrazyones.it/spot-en.html) campaign by Apple
in 1997 is now a cult favorite. Never has this video failed to inspire me, even
as a person who despises motivational porn.

I have been thinking about the kind of researcher I want to become. And
something from Jobs' approach to marketing has struck a nerve with me.

I'm quoting[^a] some of the parts relevant to a researcher, especially to
the aspects pertaining to communicating science.

Much of a researcher's life is about positioning oneself in a vast sea of
people and ideas. The world is messy. A chance to make a mark is astronomically
low. Everyone is competing for attention; everyone is competing for relevance.
Doing science is getting harder.

The key question is then this -

> _what investments will you make to retain relevance and vitality?_.

Perhaps, the only way to answer this question is to find what is meaningful to
oneself - a set of core values that define happiness and success in research,
exclusive to me.

This is a deep question, something that will require a thought far
longer than the half-hour I spent drafting this post. The idea seed has been
sown, and I will let the thought simmer.
