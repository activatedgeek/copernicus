Many a time, we find ourselves in a situation where old ideas which have been
proven false often still get some love. Perhaps, the most prominent of examples
is astrology. [This Economist article](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/05/27/voters-should-curb-mexicos-power-hungry-president) has given me a precise
term for such a situation.

Quoting from the article,

> ... what Moisés Naím, a Venezuelan journalist, calls _ideological necrophilia_ -
> a love of ideas that have been tried and proved not to work.

To a great extent, this nostalgia for (potentially stupid) ideas of the past was
also symbolized as [_Member Berries_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_Berries)
from South Park.
