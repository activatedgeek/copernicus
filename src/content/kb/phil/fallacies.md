I have certainly been trapped by many cognitive fallacies over time. This
post is a conscious effort to explicitly attach names to those as I read more.
For the ones I cannot attach names to, I'll probably assign one (until I
discover I've reinvented a concept).

### Raw List

I will expand on these in due time. Perhaps, I may have personal anecdotes.
