An article on [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/06/25/the-world-should-think-better-about-catastrophic-and-existential-risks) reminds that humanity, from time immemorial, has faced existential risks either natural or man-made. [Black
Swan events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) have dominated
major progress in societies. I believe the paranoia associated with such events
and ideas is overblown. Instead, these are opportunities to learn a lesson around
designing robust socieities of the future and minimizing life's entropy. Protecting
elitist institutions, racist ideologies and power are truly inconsequential in
the larger scheme of things. This is especially a reminder to the ones still stuck
in the means of the medieval ages.

## Risks

I'm keeping an incomplete list of existential risks to humanity here and hoping
to find opportunities to reduce entropy introduced by these events.

- [Coronal Mass Ejection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection) (CME), [The Carrington Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_1859_geomagnetic_storm)

- Pandemics

  - Disease X

- Supervolcanic Eruptions

  - Ash clouds

- Hypernova Explosions

  - Gamma-ray bursts

- Asteroids & Comets

- Nuclear Winter

  - Dust accumulated in the stratosphere

- Climate change
  - Runaway Greenhouse Effect

### Sci-Fi

Some risks are still being evaluated largely from an anthropolgical impact
perspective. These are perhaps more dystopian sci-fi risks, _so far_.

- Superhuman AI

- Bioweapons

- [Kessler Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome)

## Books

### [The Precipice](https://theprecipice.com)

by _Toby Ord_

The resources and appendix in this book are extremely rich. One of the quotes
from the book is quite extraordinary, by _Thomas Macaulay_ in 1830.

> We cannot absolutely prove that htose are in error who tell us that society has
> reached a turning point, that we have seen our best days. But so said all before
> us, and with just as much apparent reason... On what principle is it that, when we
> see nothing but improvement behind us, we are to expect nothing but deterioration
> before us?

Succinctly said, the burden is on the pessimist to explain why _now_ is the
point things will fail. Climate change, for instance, is a prominent example in
recent decades where the pessimists have had a hard time convincing the legislators
and general populace Fortunately, the past decade has seen almost a 40% drop in
demand. Nevertheless, this will remain a concern for every new realization of an
existential risk.

The only thing that can change, however, is our receptiveness to such
realizations with extreme consequences. Will we shun them only because they
appear too unlikely, or will we fund their research to get to the truth? Yet
again, the only thing that can save humanity is an open mind driven by the
scientific method.
