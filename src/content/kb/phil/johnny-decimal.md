I came across a very simple and practical organization system called the
[Johnny Decimal System](https://johnnydecimal.com). Apparently, this is proposed
by [Johnny Noble](https://johnnydecimal.com/contact/). I'm amused (or is this really
the name?).

My [knowledge organization](/kb/elements-of-the-knowledge-base) is partly inspired
by this. I summarize some key points below.

- Everything is organized into **areas** and **categories**. It is a two-level
  organization system where it is advised to not have too many of them.

- **IDs** are assigned as serial decimal numbers from 00-99. There's no pre-defined
  order attached to these numbers and semantics are defined on the go as needed. While
  nothing stops us from going beyond 99, at this point, one may have _over-organized_
  and should split up an area.

- Using this organization on a file system, nothing is ever more than **two levels
  deep**.

- It **allows exceptions** to all the rules, which aren't many in the first place.
  It's pragmatic and I like it!
