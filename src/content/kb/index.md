This is my _second brain_.

The objective here is to ease the reader (including myself) into the database
via well-purposed directions instead of a large flat archive. This makes knowledge
collection more meaningful.

A good place to start reading is my [Knowledge Organization Philosophy](/kb/knowledge-base-organization-philosophy).
To see how I realize this philosophy, read the [Elements of the Knowledge Base](/kb/elements-of-the-knowledge-base). From then on, the overview pages of each area
linked below are the place to go.

## Areas

Everything is categorized into a few primary "areas". [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents)
has already done a great job of organizing knowledge. I'm taking a page off
their book, appropriate some of those areas.

### [:performing_arts: Culture](/overview/cult)

This area includes everything that the human activity has produced in terms of
arts, media, food, literature, etc. In the performing arts, take a look at my
[Movies & TV](/kb/movies-and-tv) and [Music](/kb/music). I listen to a fair bit of
[Podcasts](/kb/podcasts) and try to read some [Books](/kb/books). I do have some
medium to long term goals on [Books I want to write](/kb/books-i-want-to-write).
I hate cooking, maybe because I suck. Nevertheless, I have some quick
[Recipes](/kb/cooking-recipes) for the desperate times.

### [:abacus: Mathematics](/overview/math)

Mathematics is the language of nature. Or at least the best thing that humans
have at disposal to understand nature. This is a collection of posts around
computer science, machine learning, reinforcement learning
and other research-y topics I am involved in.

### [:gear: Meta](/overview/meta)

Posts in this area are meant to explain the _system behind the system_. It
includes this page and the [about](/) page. Visit [The Stack](/kb/the-stack)
to get a summary of all the tools used to build the website.

### [:dna: Natural sciences](/overview/nat)

This is the home to topics in physics, chemistry, biology, geology among other
natural sciences. The more formal sciences with some semblance of laid out rules
go under [Mathematics](#mathematics). For instance, take a look at some
[Chronological dating techniques](/kb/chronological-dating-techniques).

### [:adult: People](/overview/people)

This area hosts content that starts at individual personalities and their legacies.
I've collected a few personalities at the [People Overview](/kb/overview/people) page.
These are websites I occasionally drop by on a sunny day. On a sad day,
I usually procrastinate by watching [movies](/kb/movies-and-tv); or revisit some [adages](/kb/adages-quotes).

### [:infinity: Philosophy](/overview/phil)

Topics like metaphysics find their place under the Philosophy area. Here's a
collection of [Existential Risks](/kb/existential-risks) humanity faces. It also
hosts Psychology. See this collection on concepts in [Cognitive and Experimental
Psychology](/kb/cognitive-and-experimental-psychology). I've also collected a
[Big Fat list of Mental Models](/kb/big-fat-list-of-mental-models).

### [:books: Reference](/overview/ref)

This area is dedicated to collecting reference materials. Take a look at
[Textbooks on various subjects](/kb/textbooks-on-various-subjects) for a comprehensive
list of reference texts on topics that have achieved _critical mass_. For now,
this is dominated by texts in machine learning. I'll expand this as I read more.

I'm collecting a set of [Common Yardsticks](/kb/common-yardsticks) to address
quantities that we encounter daily. This is my effort towards _numerical literacy_ and a
back-of-the-envelope temperament. Further, I am trying to map the modern
[World material](/kb/world-materials) flows qualitatively. This will help
me map the value chain and understand societies better. [Data Sources](/kb/data-sources)
should come in handy for this.

### [:classical_building: Society](/overview/soc)

Everything that humans do collectively as a "society" goes in here. This involves
topics in economics, journalism, business etc. It also includes my general
rants and observations.

I'm particularly interested in collecting [Real Life Decision Making Systems](/kb/real-life-decision-making-systems).
This is a humbling excercise. Some decisions are reversible. Irreversible decisions
with large ripple effects may turn out to be deadly. We've already seen this with
COVID-19 and government responses, circa 2020. We cannot do without uncertainty
quantification and this is a page to remind myself of that.

### [:rocket: Technology](/overview/tech)

This area involves collecting knowledge about the "process" of driving value
from raw materials. I note a few [Products](/kb/products) I like. This is usually
the area where I write about software engineering and related ideas.

I am really interested in this question: [Are ideas becoming harder to find?](/kb/are-ideas-becoming-harder-to-find)
