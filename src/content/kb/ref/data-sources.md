I've always wondered about stupid questions like "how many of those toilet papers were sold per household?" \(funny I actually found something [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fzxhsc/rolls_of_toilet_paper_used_per_person_per_year_oc/fn6k3d9/)\). For all the important things in life though, it is surprising that we have so much data available out in the open. I think we live in a glorious time.
