I've started visualizing some data on maps.[^search]

## Places

:world_map: [A Map of All Places I have Visited](//maps.sanyamkapoor.com/places).

Another dataset that I am starting to map is from one of my favorite food and travel shows :tv: [Somebody Feed Phil](https://www.netflix.com/title/80146601).

## Somebody Fed Phil

:world_map: [Somebody Fed Phil](//maps.sanyamkapoor.com/somebody-fed-phil).

!> :bulb: If you don't see anything, try rotating the globe to Thailand.

Eventually, I'd love to document what Phil ate, perhaps add pictures. In a sense, this is very much my travel wishlist.

## Wine

:wine_glass: [Map of All Wines I have tasted](//maps.sanyamkapoor.com/wine).

!> :bulb: Read more on [My Wine Map](/kb/my-wine-map).

[^search]: I want to make it easier to make the maps more searchable.
