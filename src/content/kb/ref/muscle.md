My checklist, in order of priorities:[^leangains]

- Eat only 8 hours every day.
- Ideally in the same time period lift _heavy_ at least 3 times a week.
- If you are doing > 10 reps, that is not heavy. 3-4 sets per exercise.
- [RPT](https://leangains.com/reverse-pyramid-training-guide/) for only 1 or 2 exercises (I don't do this)
- Adequate rest between each set (at least 3 minutes, 5+ for deadlifts)
- At least 2 days of rest between any sets of squats and deadlifts.
- Eat roughly 2.5-3 grams of protein for every kg of bodyweight
- Eat a bit more on workout days (+20%), and eat less (-20%) on non-workout days. For workout days, eat more carbs and less fat. Vice versa for non-workout days

## Calories

My maximum potential with bulk is 160 lbs. The rest of my statistics are roughly:[^tdee]

| Mode        | Daily (kcal)                                | Weekly (kcal) |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Maintenance | 2400                                        | 16600         |
| Cut         | 1900 (140g protein / 75g fat / 160g carbs)  | 13000         |
| Bulk        | 2900 (220g protein / 110g fat / 250g carbs) | 20000         |
