Historically, science has made great strides because someone cared to ask,
_how much_? This is my concerted effort towards _numerical literacy_ in the modern
world. Assigning tangible quantities is immensely effective towards understanding
the metaphorical "gravity of the situation".

All values are approximate and meant to facilitate back-of-the-envelope calculations.
I highly recommend [Measurement: A Very Short Introduction](https://www.librarything.com/work/19217884/book/196759822) for a short history of measurements, and a crash-course
in how different fields have evolved in assigning numbers to phenomenon.
