## Allegories

### [The Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave)

There's various interpretations, but I was particularly struck by the context
of this allegory for Representation Learning in Machine Learning. This was
described in the ICML 2020 [tutorial](https://icml.cc/virtual/2020/tutorial/5751)
"Representation Learning Without Labels" by _S. M. Ali Eslami, Irina Higgins, Danilo J. Rezende_.

This distinguishes between a "true reality" and an "observed reality". This is
a notion central to generative processes induced by probabilistic models.
