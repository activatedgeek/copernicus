[Nikolai Vavilov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Vavilov) was
raised in an era when food shortages were very frequent in erstwhile
Soviet Union. He became obsessed with ending famine to the extent that
he created the world's largest plant seed bank in Lenningrad. His
meticulous scientific study of cultivated crops across the world
advanced our understanding of their genetics. We now recognize his
research to be immensely impactful in sustaining the world population.
I'd be remiss to not mention his collaborating scientists who believed just
as much if not more, in scientific inquiry. During the
[Siege of Lenningrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Leningrad) by
Nazi Germany, they protected the seed bank and did not consume them despite
starvation.

Vavilov worked in the Stalin era and was vehemently opposed by
[Trofim Lysenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko). Unfortunate
for Vavilov, Lysenko had Stalin's ears. Lysenko was an influential
in perpetuating anti-Mendelian genetics, push back progress in the field
in Russian scientific community by decades. Vavilov was arrested in 1940
for this dissent. He was sentenced to death, but later commuted to a
20-year prison term. Ironically, he died of starvation in captivity a few
years later. Some of the scientists during the Siege of Lenningrad, faced
the same fate.

[Where Our Food Comes From: Retracing Nikolay Vavilov's Quest to End Famine](https://www.librarything.com/work/7565437) by Gary Paul Nabhan is a recommended book into
this story.

## Remarks

This is an extraordinary story. Vavilov is a paragon of scientific
excellence. His belief in scientific inquiry was undeterred until
his last breath, despite institutional opposition from the highest
powers. Eventually, Vavilov was exonerated and recognized as a hero.
I wish he could live to see how he immensely he impacted the world.

This is yet another example of ideology trumping science and leading
to catastrophic failure.
