_Yokai_ are monsters from Japanese folklore, described as talismanic. The first
stories date back to the 8th century. _Toriyama Sekien_ documented this folklore
into a graphic encylopedia titled, _The Illustrated Night Parade of a Hundred
Demons_, further solidifying their place in Japanese culture. This was
the first time oral descriptions of these creatures came to life in pictures
and unsurprisingly, was an instant hit among the masses. People explained the
unknown by appealing to these _Yokai_.

_Inoue Enryō_ took it upon himself to use the scientific method to bust these
myths. He created an area of research called the _Yokigau_ and with that became
sort of a ghostbuster. His thorough work, to the dissatisfaction of some, quashed
many erstwhile Japanese customs and traditions. This cultural shift was an
immense driver of Japanese modernization post the _Edo period_.

## Remarks

This story is very fascinating. In fact, it is very satisfying to me. It's
even relevant today in the age of _fast information_. We need more cynics and
critics in the common masses. Not just for the sake of it, not for partisan
politics, not for personal preferences, not for stakeholder satisfaction.
But to make sure the right message reaches the most vulnerable groups, as is.
Getting the delivery right is not enough, though. The receiving end should be
analytical enough to process that information and appropriate it to their
needs.

I want to be a mythbuster.
