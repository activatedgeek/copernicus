I learned about [Narendra Dabholkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Dabholkar)
in an excellent story about [religious idols drinking milk](https://fiftytwo.in/story/milk/)
in 1995. This saga captured the imagination of every Indian for at least a few
days until the _mythbusters_ convincingly proved a rather undivine intervention
to explain the phenomenon. I highly recommend reading this long-form. It speaks
volumes for the religious fervour of the people of the time. Alas, at the time
of this writing, I would even say that the temperament has not departed too far
from where it was quarter of a century ago.

Dabholkar was certainly among the brighter spots in society. He showed admirable
rationality in front of the unapologetically superstitious. He was the founder
of the rationalist group [Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra_Andhashraddha_Nirmoolan_Samiti) (MANS). I am quite excited that
there exists an organization in India that takes this plague head on.

Unfortunately, he was murdered in 2013 by extremist right-wing
elements (allegedly, of course) during a time when he was spearheading the
[Anti-Superstition and Black Magic Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Superstition_and_Black_Magic_Act). This is an undeserved conclusion for
the life one of the rarer faction of people. This should be a stark reminder
for all of us that the ideological war is a long and hard one.

India needs more _Dabholkars_.
