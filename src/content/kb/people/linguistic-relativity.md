[Linguistic Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) (also known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in linguistics) posits a causal connection between language and thought. In its strongest form it suggests that ideas that lack a linguistic label are unthinkable.

> much as the very concept of being "free" is destroyed in George Orwell's "Nineteen Eighty-Four", while the regular use of other labels forces peopleâ€™s thinking into approved patterns.
