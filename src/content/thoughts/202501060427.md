My girlfriend claims I have an all-or-nothing attitude, and she is right. Despite understanding compounding quite well, I still fail to put in small effort at the gym everyday because I know Iâ€™ll fail to get my nutrition right. Despite having small wins, I fail to appreciate them in the hopes of a bigger win. This attitude is broken.
