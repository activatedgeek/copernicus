What is the phenomenon of people wanting something but then not showing up called?

For instance, movie studios after all the cry of dying theaters just eventually end up releasing movies on streaming platforms instead. We are stuck in a vicious cycle - studios don't release in theaters because people don't go; people don't go to theaters because studios release on streaming.
